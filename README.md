# Ethereum Sender

The Ethereum Sender project allows you to automatically send ETH from one wallet to another. By providing a private key for your ETH wallet and a recipient's public key, the script will monitor the wallet for incoming ETH and automatically initiate transfers to the specified recipient.
For more detailed information, you can read [my blog post](https://sobhan.hashnode.dev/unveiling-ethereum-transfer-a-deep-dive-into-sweeper-bots-for-ethereum) dedicated to this project.

## Features

- Automatic ETH transfer from one wallet to another.
- Real-time monitoring of the wallet balance.
- Configurable transaction threshold for initiating transfers.
- private key management.

## Requirements

- Ethereum wallet with a private key.
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Web3.py library for Ethereum interaction.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
 `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the `.env` file and update the following information:
- `VICTIM_KEY`: The victim Ethereum wallet private key.
- `RECIPIENT_ADDRESS`: The public key of the recipient's Ethereum wallet.
- `ganache_mode`: Set this to `True` if you want to use Ganache for testing purposes, or `False` to use [Infura](https://infura.io) for the mainnet.
Add your Infura API key to the INFURA_APIKEY variable in the config.py file.

Save the changes in the config.py file.

Run the main script main.py using the command:

## Usage

1. Make sure you have configured the `.env` file with the correct information.
2. Run the script using the following command: python main.py
3. The script will start monitoring the specified wallet for incoming ETH.
